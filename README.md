# odin-forms
Building a webpage with a form that has built-in client side validation

## [Live Demo](https://github.com/salaga-py2021/odin-forms)

Things to Improve: 
1. Add Dark Mode for the WebPage
2. Improve CSS for the Code
    - In CSS, Add X Marks for when the user entry is wrong
3. Create CSS Variables to Keep Track of Things
4. Have the tabs travel horizontally instead of going vertically
5. Refactor Lines 31-41 to ensure DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
